He has worked with Floorworld and AFLW star Monique Conti creating corporate style videos. Patrick has always been interested in pursuing Information Technology. Patrick is Interested in UCD (user-centred design). Developing applications and websites and combining different design elements and principles such as contrast, colour, typefaces can affect how the user interacts and feels and how that can influence their experience in positive and negative ways.

Ben's interest in IT began when he was 8 Years old through gaming which made him slowly more experienced and comfortable with IT systems and technology. There hasn't been any specific moment or person that sparked Ben's interests in IT; it was the collection of experiences with technology throughout his life that has led to IT. Technology is the main focus of his life choices. Ben has used many different consoles and technology, meaning he has experience in many operating systems and their many various errors and problems. Ben wants to learn more about IT to have a possible career in the field and know more about IT to assist him with different errors he could potentially run into in the future.</p>

<h2>Name: Joshua Rowarth </h2>
<h3>Student Number:s3835213 </h3>
<p>After Joshua graduated from high school, he began an International Studies degree at Deakin University. Joshua's major was Chinese, and during the degree, he studied in Shanghai, China, for six months. After Joshua returned, he changed his degree to a business/international studies double degree. Still, he ultimately found that he didn't enjoy it and couldn't find many prospects in job opportunities. Joshua has worked 28 different jobs since the age of 15, the most current and longest one being a bartender role. Joshua's interest in IT began when he was younger; thanks to his favourite Properties such as Disney's Tron and the Digimon series, both had highly fantasized elements of tech. He enjoyed studying IT in secondary school but never continued because of advice from a careers adviser. His love for video games and attempting to learn the development of games helped direct him back to university to study IT. Recently Joshua has begun working on coding, app making, website-making, game making etc. He has always wanted to make video games and found more enjoyment with the code side than the actual game design part.</p>
